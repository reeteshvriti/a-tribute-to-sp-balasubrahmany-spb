              playback singer on 15 December 1966 with Sri Sri Sri Maryada
              Ramanna, a Telugu film scored by his mentor, S. P. Kodandapani.The
              first non-Telugu song that he recorded just eight days after his
              debut Telugu song was in Kannada in 1966 for the film Nakkare Ade
              Swarga, starring Kannada comedy stalwart T. R. Narasimharaju.He
              recorded his first Tamil song "Athaanodu Ippadi Irundhu Eththanai

              of M. S. Viswanathan for the film Hotel Ramba, which was never
              released.In his words, "There were days when I used to record
              15–20 songs, but only for Anand-Milind. And I would take the last
              flight back to Chennai." In the 1970s, he also worked with M. S.
              Viswanathan in Tamil movies for actors such as M. G. Ramachandran,
              Sivaji Ganesan and Gemini Ganesan. He recorded duets with P.
              Susheela, S. Janaki, Vani Jayaram and L. R. Eswari.
